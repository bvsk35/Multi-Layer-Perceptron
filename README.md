# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
Multi-Layer Perceptron for classification

In this repo you can find my custom class built for doing classification in multi-layer perceptron/fully connected feedforward network. Detailed explaination about the code and the algorithm can be found on my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/bvsk35/technical-writing).
