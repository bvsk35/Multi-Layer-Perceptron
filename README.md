# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
Multi-Layer Perceptron for classification

In this repo you can find my custom class built for doing classification in multi-layer perceptron/fully connected feedforward network. Detailed explaination about the code and the algorithm can be found on my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/bvsk35/technical-writing). 

I have also attached a code for the purpose of illustration. I have test my code on MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset. This work far more efficiently than my previous repo on the same named as MNIST Dataset. I am able to achieve more accuracy (<4% on test set) in very few epochs (<10) and runtime is also low. There will be dataconversion warnings given scikit-learn preprocessor because the pixel data is in unit8 format (these can be ignored).
